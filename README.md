This code is going to be an assistant who will help you in the decisions of cookie clicker, since it is an "incrementer" game it is, at the same time, perfect to optimise the decisions. In this way the goals are going to be, make an assistant for players and build an intelligent code to simulate an strategy, maybe the best one.   

The first file we provide, Da_real_cookie_clicker.py, is the code initially programed, very simple, which will help you with the decision of buying an upgrade for some units or buy more units to reach earlier the cookies needed to buy it. Be carefull with the scale you use when printing the graphic because the exponential growth will hide the answer.
